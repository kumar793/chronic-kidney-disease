A xgboost model for chronic kideny disease
# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to predict Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. The system leverages various data analytics and machine learning models to analyze patient data and predict the likelihood of CKD.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Real-time prediction using a web interface
- Easy to use and extend

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ckd-prediction.git
   cd ckd-prediction
## Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
**Data Preprocessing and Model Creation**:
Run the model_creation.py script to preprocess the data and create the machine learning model.
python model_creation.py

**Run the Prediction Application**:
Start the Flask application to use the web interface for CKD prediction.
python app.py

Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to access the application.
Use the Web Interface:
Upload patient data through the web interface to get real-time CKD predictions.
